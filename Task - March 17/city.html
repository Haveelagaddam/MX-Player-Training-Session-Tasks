            <p class="card-text">Delhi is the city and national capital of India. Delhi consists of Old Delhi, the historical city located in the north; and New Delhi, the capital of India since 1947 located in the south. To the east, the territory shares boundaries with Uttar Pradesh; to the north, west and south it shares boundaries with the state of Haryana. Delhi is located astride the Yamuna river, primarily on the west bank. The territory of the national capital contains Old Delhi, New Delhi, the surrounding metropolitan region and rural areas.Delhi is a succession of mighty empires and powerful kingdoms. Delhi has been a witness to the political turmoil for over five centuries, as it was ruled by the Mughals in succession to Khiljis and Tughlaqs. Numerous ruins scattered throughout the territory offer a constant reminder of the areas history. Muhammad of Ghori captured the Rajput town in 1192, and the Sultanate of Delhi was established. In 1398, Delhi was invaded by Timur and that put and end to the sultanate. Babur then founded the Mughal Empire. At first, the Mughal emperors favoured Agra as their capital, but then Delhi became their permanent seat after Shah Jahan built the walls of Old Delhi. The city kept changing from one ruler to the other, from Hindi kings to Muslim Sultans </p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Mumbai</h5>
            <p class="card-text">Mumbai is in all ways a mega-city driven by power, wealth, glamour and fame. It is also a city with strong historical links, wonderful British architecture, museums, beaches, places of worship, and above all, a true galaxy of stars where Bollywood reigns supreme. The seven islands that came to constitute Mumbai were earlier home to communities of fishing colonies. For centuries, the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese and subsequently to the British East India Company. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped with the construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Upon Indiaâ€™s independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Sanyukta Maharashtra movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital. The city was renamed Mumbai in 1996. And in this short period of development, the city has transformed into the commercial and entertainment capital of India.</p>
